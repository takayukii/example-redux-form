# example-redux-form

This example utilize redux-form to have component's ad-hoc state on redux-form store in addition of its form values. I want my store keeping its domain data cleanly, so I tried to chase ad-hoc state off from my own store.    

## Setup

```$xslt
yarn
```

## Run

```$xslt
yarn start
```
